This is called the Acquisition Funnel.

- The Marketing Analytics Manager will work in the Marketing Acquisition team at Games24x7.

- The main job of the Marketing Analytics Manager is to identify opportunities, problems or pain points in consumers journey- right from their interaction with campaigns and landing pages to product adoption and engagement - and then build hypothesis on possible reasons for those opportunities, problems or pain points, and validate the hypothesis by analyzing data by slicing, dicing and looking at various variables that might be affecting consumer behavior.

Tactical decisions are about which campaigns should get a bigger share of the budget and which less. Strategic decisions are about using player behavior data to arrive at insights about the player decision making process. These insights feed into the design of new advertisements, new landing pages and even changes to the core product, which would ultimately improve the Acquisition Funnel and improve ROI.
